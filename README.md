## Feedback 
### Hugo Sundberg 
1. In small sizes, left margin is none but right has margin. This could probably be done with flex or grid to avoid jumps and margin-diffs. 

2. A lot of values are set in 'px' that could be set in rem to enhance responsiveness and accesibillity. 

3. Some articles are broken in IE 11. ;)

4. Footer.php is empty 

5. There is a typo in README.md on pine 22.
