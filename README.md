## Feedback 
### Hugo Sundberg 
1. In small sizes, left margin is none but right has margin. This could probably be done with flex or grid to avoid jumps and margin-diffs. 

2. A lot of values are set in 'px' that could be set in rem to enhance responsiveness and accesibillity. 

3. Some articles are broken in IE 11. ;)

4. Footer.php is empty 

5. There is a typo in README.md on pine 22.

## Feedback
### Márk Mados

1. There is an open <?php> tag in the header.php on line 27.
2. The title "Fake News Factory" size could be bigger and more outstanding from the nav bar.
3. The date in the articles would have been easier to read if the month would have been displayed in text.
4. The numbers inside the Like button could be problematic to see if the numbers grow over 100 likes.
5. The title could have been clickable to return to the homepage.

Critics aside, awesome work! I love it!
